# Welcome to my GitHub

I love creating games. There it is, four words that my life revolves around at the moment. It took me some time to figure out, but now I'm here. That's why I'm a student at Yrgos Game Creator Programmer, that's why I have this page and hopefully that's the reason why you are here.

If someone would have asked me about programming a few years back I would have probably just given them a an indifferent shrug - now it's my greatest passion. I may just be a log floating in the sea of life, but I am now a log with a goal.

I want to become a skilled, creative and versatile programmer. Nothing more, nothing less.

Don't be afraid to contact me with any questions or suggestions.

Best regards,

Linus
