I Love Creating Games.

There they are, the four words that my life revolves around at the moment. It took me some time to figure out, but now I'm here. Eager to learn everything I can about game development, devoted to sharpening all my skills and tools. That's why I'm a student at Yrgos Game Creator Programmer, that's why I have this page and hopefully that's the reason why you are here.

If someone would have asked me about programming a few years back I would have probably just given them an indifferent shrug - now it's my greatest passion. Strange, but true. I may just be a log floating in the sea of life, but now I'm a log with a clear goal.

I want to become a skilled, creative and versatile programmer. Nothing more, nothing less.

I appreciate your visit, don't be afraid to contact me with any questions or suggestions.

Best regards,

Linus
