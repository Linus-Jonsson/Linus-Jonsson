# Welcome to my GitHub

I love creating games. There it is, four words that my life right now spins around. It took me some time to figure out, but now I'm here and I want to learn everything I can about game development.

If someone would have asked me about programming a few years back I would have probably just given them a an indifferent shrug - now it's my greatest passion. I may just be a log floating in the sea of life, but I am now a log with a goal.

I want to become a skilled, creative and versatile programmer. Nothing more, nothing less.
